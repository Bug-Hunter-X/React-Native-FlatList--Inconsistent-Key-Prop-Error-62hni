This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent key prop to the items being rendered.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently manage and update the list items. If the keys are not unique or change unexpectedly, it can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering or performance issues. For example, if you use an index as the key and then insert or delete items, the keys may become mismatched, leading to the error.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage - using index as key
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item, index }) => <Text key={index}>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
